        <h1>CS 180 Project 3 - Face Morphing and Modelling a Photo Collection by Eshani Jha</h1>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In this project, I explored face morphing techniques, including warping facial features and blending colors between two images. 
              I started by defining corresponding points between two faces and used triangulation to create a smooth transition. I then implemented 
              affine transformations to compute a mid-way face, which combines the shapes and colors of the input images. Additionally, I created a 
              morph sequence between two faces, generating an animation from one face to another. Finally, I computed the mean face of a population and 
              extrapolated from this average to produce a caricature. These exercises helped me deepen my understanding of affine warps, 
              image interpolation, and facial feature manipulation.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Defining Correspondences</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>To define pairs of corresponding points between two faces, I used a labeling tool from a previous CS 180 student. The keypoints were 
              consistently labeled across both faces, ensuring smooth transitions. For this project, I labeled my own face and that of Priyanka Chopra, 
              a well-known Bollywood actress. Once labeled, I computed a Delaunay triangulation based on the midway shape between the two point sets, as 
              this reduces triangle deformation during morphing. This triangulation was used to control the warping process for a smoother morph result.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Computing the "Mid-Way Face"</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>To create the mid-way face between my face and Priyanka Chopra's, I started by computing the average shape, which involved averaging 
              the corresponding keypoints of both faces. Next, I warped both faces into this new shape by calculating affine transformations for 
              each triangle in the triangulation. These transformations mapped the original triangles to their positions in the average shape. I then used inverse 
              warping to determine the pixel colors for each triangle. Finally, I blended the two images by averaging the colors together, producing a smooth transition. 
              Below, you can see the original images of myself and Priyanka Chopra, along with the resulting mid-way face.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">The Morph Sequence</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>For the morph sequence, I wrote a function that produces a smooth transition between my face and Priyanka Chopra's face. This function uses 
              point correspondences and triangulation to warp both images into intermediate shapes, controlled by parameters for warping and dissolving the 
              images. By varying these parameters, I generated a sequence of frames that smoothly morph my face into Priyanka's. The result is a video 
              sequence as an animated gif.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Results</h3>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I sharpened the image of the Taj Mahal using different sharpening intensities with alpha values of 1, 2, and 3. As the alpha increases, 
                the edges of the image become more defined, and the architectural details of the building stand out more prominently, especially at the 
                highest alpha value. This sharpening process mimics the techniques used in modern smartphone cameras to enhance image quality, making 
                details clearer and crisper in photos.

        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Extra Results</h3>
        <div class="content">
            <p>For demonstration, I applied the unsharp mask technique to several images including flowers, water, and cows. In the case of the rose 
            flowers, sharpening revealed intricate details such as wrinkles in the petals that were not noticeable before. Similarly, in the image 
            of the cow, the sharpening made the individual blades of grass appear much crisper and more defined. However, for the image of water, 
            the effect was minimal. This is likely due to the smoother nature of the surface, which lacks the fine details that benefit from sharpening.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here I used the Danes dataset and focused on the neutral male and female subcategories. I computed the average face shape for each group 
              by averaging the annotated keypoints. Then, I warped two images from the datasets into these average shapes, showing how they transform to fit the 
              average geometry. Finally, I also warped my own face to match the average shape (andd vice versa). Below, you can see the results of the average face, the warped 
              dataset images, and my face transformed into the average shape.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>To create caricatures of my face, I extrapolated from the population mean of the neutral females from the Danes dataset. I calculated the 
              difference between my facial keypoints and the average keypoints, then amplified this difference to create exaggerated versions of my face. 
              By adding 1.5 times the difference, I generated a more pronounced caricature, and with 0.5 times the difference, I created a subtler version. 
              After warping my face into these new shapes, I cropped the images to remove any excess background, highlighting the exaggerated features.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>I applied the same blending technique to combine images of a BMW and a Mercedes, blending them down the middle. Since the images
            had different sizes and orientations, I first used <em>align_image_code.py</em> to align and resize them. I chose the car hood and wheel axle as alignment points. 
            This step ensured that the bodies of both cars were properly aligned, allowing for a smooth transition at the seam. After alignment, 
            the blending process effectively merged the two car images without noticeable distortions.</p>

        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Extra Results - Irregular Mask</h3>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I then experimented with an irregular mask, blending an image of water droplets on a leaf with an image of roses. Using the mask, I made 
            each water droplet contain part of the rose image. The result was a visually striking effect, where the droplets appeared as though they were 
            filled with roses. I think this is what true "rose water" should look like!</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Bells and Whistles</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>For the "Bells and Whistles" part of my project, I experimented with morphing just the shape, just the appearance, and both the shape 
              and appearance between my face and Priyanka Chopra's. I created three different morphs: one that focused purely on shape transformation, another 
              that blended only the appearance, and a final morph that combined both. Morphing just the appearance led to changes in skin tone, texture, and smile. 
              Morphing the shape modified the facial structure, contributing to a change in perceived ethnicity.
