        <h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In this project, I took a look into the fascinating process of image mosaicing by warping and stitching multiple photographs into seamless 
              mosaics. Using manually selected correspondence points, I also aligned images through homography transformations. This technique not only allows for the 
              creation of captivating panoramas, but also demonstrates how projective warping can be applied to rectify images to fit alternate perspectives.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Shoot the Pictures</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>For this project, I used my Samsung Galaxy S22+ to capture high-quality photographs with fixed frame rates and consistent lighting conditions. To create variety, 
              I also incorporated video game screenshots by manually panning across different sections of the in-game map with my mouse, capturing individual screenshots to later 
              stitch into a cohesive mosaic. The goal was to ensure that the transformations between images are projective (i.e., perspective transformations). This is typically 
              achieved by fixing the center of projection and rotating the camera during capture. I took care to follow these principles to ensure smooth image alignment and warping.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Recover Homographies</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>To align the images in the mosaic, I used the same correspondence tool from Project 3 to manually label matching features between each pair of images. This process 
              generated two sets of corresponding points: <code>src_pts</code> for the source image and <code>dst_pts</code> for the target image. Using these points, I computed the homography matrix following the 
              Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) approach, as outlined in the referenced paper. </p>
            <p>For each pair of correspondence points <em>(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)</em> and <em>(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>)</em>, two constraint vectors are created to 
              form part of the system of equations:</p>

            <pre>
            Vector 1: [-x₁, -y₁, -1, 0, 0, 0, x₁ · x₂, y₁ · x₂, x₂]
            Vector 2: [0, 0, 0, -x₁, -y₁, -1, x₁ · y₂, y₁ · y₂, y₂]
            </pre>

            <p> These vectors are derived by eliminating the scale factor <em>w'</em> in the target homogeneous coordinates, ensuring consistency across the transformation. 
              The resulting vectors are stacked into a matrix <code>A</code>, which captures the relationship between the source and target points. Next, I passed matrix 
              <code>A</code> through the SVD function <code>np.linalg.svd(A)</code>, obtaining the matrices <code>U</code>, <code>S</code>, and <code>V<sup>T</sup></code>. The row of 
              <code>V<sup>T</sup></code> (or the column of <code>V</code>) corresponding to the smallest singular value gives the solution vector <code>v</code>. This vector contains 
              the elements of the flattened homography matrix.</p>
            <p>Finally, I reshaped <code>v</code> into a <code>3 × 3</code> matrix <code>H</code>. To ensure the homography matrix is properly scaled, I divided each element of 
              <code>H</code> by the value in its bottom-right corner. This normalized matrix <code>H</code> provides the transformation needed to warp the source image into the 
              perspective of the target image.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Warp the Images</h2>
        <div class="content">
                <p> To align images into a seamless mosaic, I implemented a custom warping function that leverages a homography matrix to map the source image into the target 
                  perspective. The homography matrix transforms the corners of the source image, defining the new bounds and creating a pixel grid for the warped image. Using inverse 
                  mapping, each pixel in the target image is then traced back to its corresponding location in the source image. At these locations, I applied bilinear interpolation 
                  to compute smooth pixel values by blending the intensities of neighboring pixels. This ensures that the transitions between images are visually smooth and free of 
                  harsh boundaries.
              <p>
                  The final warped images preserve spatial relationships and aligns accurately with the target image, setting the stage for blending multiple images into a unified mosaic.</p>        

    <div>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Image Rectification</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>As part of testing the homography and warping functions, I performed image rectification on objects with known shapes. This process ensures that the code works 
              correctly by transforming tilted or distorted objects back into their proper rectangular form. I captured images with objects such as my laptop screen and LED remote at an 
              angle and used the homography transformation to "flatten" their appearance. 
          <p>Interestingly, when rectifying the remote control, the transformation not only corrected the perspective but also revealed finer details that were initially hard to see. 
            Surprisingly, symbols like the <em>AUTO</em> button and the <em>W</em> symbol (for white light) became clearly visible after rectification. This demonstrates the power of 
            perspective correction in uncovering subtle features within an image.</p>

    <div>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Blending into a Mosaic</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>First, I computed a homography matrix to warp one image onto the plane of another. Then, I calculated the bounding box and necessary shifts to align the 
              warped image with the target image. Finally, both images were stitched together within the mosaic by placing them at their computed positions in the combined frame.</p>
            <p>I applied this process to create a mosaic of stuffed animals (real-world example) and used blending techniques to eliminate sharp edges. I also experimented with Dota 2 
              screenshots to explore how parts of a video game map look on a larger scale, as the in-game view is limited. I tested the process on different landscapes, including the 
              “lane,” which contains mostly similar textures, and the “river,” which has intricate water details.</p>
