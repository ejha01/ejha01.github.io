                The objective of this project was to bring history to life by transforming the digitized 
                Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate images into vivid color photographs, using advanced image processing 
                techniques. These glass plate images, captured over a century ago, each contain three separate exposures 
                representing the red, green, and blue channels of a scene. Our challenge was to seamlessly align and merge 
                these channels to reconstruct a full-color image, minimizing any visible artifacts. Through careful extraction, 
                alignment, and processing of the individual color layers, we aimed to recreate these historical moments with 
                modern clarity, while preserving their original essence.

            <p>
                In this project, I tackled the challenge of aligning the red and green channels to the blue channel 
                using a simple x, y translation model. By treating the blue channel as the anchor, I implemented a brute 
                force search over a displacement range of [-15, 15] x [-15, 15], aiming to find the best alignment using 
                Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC).
            </p>

            <p>
                The alignment process involved normalizing each image channel and then calculating the dot product between 
                the shifted and reference channels. This allowed me to determine how well they aligned based on their pixel 
                similarities. For every possible shift, I computed the NCC score and tracked the displacement with the highest 
                value, ensuring the most accurate alignment.
            </p>

            <p>
                At first, I faced a peculiar issue where the algorithm stubbornly returned a (0, 0) shiftâ€”basically, no alignment 
                at all. After investigating, I found that the culprit was the noisy edges of the images, which threw off the 
                alignment calculations. To fix this, I cropped 10% off the borders of each image before running the alignment. Additionally, 
                I used np.roll for circular translations, which kept the image intact by wrapping pixels around instead of introducing 
                zeros during the shift.

                Aligning high-resolution images using brute force methods is inefficient, especially when dealing with larger 
                .tif images where the displacements extend far beyond the small window of [-15, 15]. Searching blindly across a 
                larger space becomes extremely slow. To overcome this, I employed a pyramid search algorithm that drastically speeds 
                up the process by scaling the images down and progressively refining the alignment.
            </p>

            <p>
                The algorithm works by first downscaling the image by a factor of 2 until it reaches a manageable size, typically 
                around 100-200 pixels. At this reduced resolution, I perform the alignment using a broad search window of [-20, 20]. 
                Once the alignment is calculated at this coarse scale, I upscale both the image and the calculated offset by a factor 
                of 2 and then search within a smaller range of [-2, 2]. This process repeats at increasingly higher resolutions, refining 
                the offset each time until we return to the original image size.
            </p>

            <p>
                This coarse-to-fine approach ensures the alignment process is both efficient and accurate, even for high-resolution images, without sacrificing precision.

                For further refinement of the color channel alignment, I applied a Sobel filter, which is 
                commonly used for edge detection in images. This technique helps to align the sharp transitions 
                in brightness between different parts of the image, making the alignment process more robust, 
                especially in cases where strong edges are present. By first applying the Sobel filter to each 
                color channel (Blue, Green, and Red), I focused on aligning the edges between the channels, ensuring 
                that key image details like borders and contours were matched up more precisely.
            </p>

            <p>
                After filtering, I used the Pyramid search algorithm to align the Sobel-processed channels, which improved 
                the accuracy of the offsets compared to the non-filtered version. Once I had the Sobel-based alignment, I used 
                those calculated offsets to align the original, unfiltered channels. This approach proved particularly effective 
                for certain images, where subtle improvements in alignment were critical for visual quality.
            </p>

            <p>
                A significant improvement can be seen in the alignment of "emir.tif." Without Sobel filtering, the offsets for the 
                Green and Red channels were (43, 78) and (-334, 126), respectively. However, after applying the Sobel filter, these 
                offsets were refined to (16, 78) for the Green channel and (33, 142) for the Red channel, leading to a much cleaner final image.
